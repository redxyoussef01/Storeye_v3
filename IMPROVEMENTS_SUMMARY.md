# Intersection Analysis Improvements

## Changes Made

### ðŸ”§ **Improvement 1: Fixed Hand-Based Object Counting**

**Problem**: System was counting total objects per frame instead of objects per unique hand.

**Example Issue**:
- Frame has Hand 2 with 1 water bottle + Hand 3 with 1 water bottle
- Old system: Counted 2 objects total (incorrect logic)
- New system: Counts 1 object for Hand 2 + 1 object for Hand 3 = 2 objects total (correct)

**Solution**:
- Group objects by `hand_id` within each frame
- Count objects per unique hand
- Sum objects across all hands in the frame
- Take maximum across all frames in folder

**Code Changes**:
- Updated `analyze_intersections.py` line 119-142
- Added `objects_per_hand` tracking in per-frame analysis
- Enhanced CSV output to show hand-specific counts

### ðŸ“Š **Improvement 3: Frequency-Based Counting for Duplicate Frames**

**Problem**: System was summing objects across ALL duplicate frames instead of finding the most frequent count.

**Example Issue**:
- 5 duplicate frames of Hand 14 with 1 coffee-cup each
- Old system: 5 objects total (summed all frames)
- New system: 1 object (most frequent count per hand)

**Solution**:
- For each hand, collect object counts across all frames
- Find the most frequent (mode) count for each hand
- Sum the frequent counts across all unique hands
- Handle duplicate frames intelligently

**Code Changes**:
- Replaced summation logic with frequency analysis
- Added `hand_frame_counts` tracking per hand across frames
- Updated output to show "frequent objects count"
- Enhanced global summary with frequency-based totals

### ðŸŽ¯ **Improvement 2: Hand Bounding Box Padding**

**Problem**: Objects near hands weren't being detected as intersecting due to tight bounding boxes.

**Example Issue**:
```
chunk_10_20250701_150031_622_hand14.jpg,0,coffee-cup,0.7525,325,701,440,814,False,0.0558,14,"438,687,604,776"
```
- Coffee cup at (325,701,440,814) 
- Hand at (438,687,604,776)
- Should intersect but IoU was too low (0.0558)

**Solution**:
- Added configurable padding (`HAND_BBOX_PADDING = 20px`) to hand bounding boxes
- Apply padding during intersection calculation only
- Keep original hand bbox in CSV for reference
- Visual debugging shows both original (blue) and padded (cyan) boxes

**Code Changes**:
- Added `apply_hand_bbox_padding()` function in `object_classification.py`
- Updated intersection calculation to use padded boxes
- Added visual debugging option with `DRAW_PADDED_HAND_BBOX`

## Configuration Options

```python
# object_classification.py
HAND_BBOX_PADDING: int = 20          # Padding in pixels
DRAW_PADDED_HAND_BBOX: bool = True   # Show debugging boxes
```

## New Output Files

1. **`{folder}_per_frame_analysis.csv`** - Now includes `objects_per_hand` column
2. **Annotated images** - Show original (blue) and padded (cyan) hand boxes
3. **Enhanced summaries** - Include hand-specific statistics

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
```
chunk_10_20250701_150000: 5 objects (water: 5)
- Summed all objects across all duplicate frames
- Over-counted due to redundant detections

chunk_10_20250701_150031: 5 objects (coffee-cup: 5)  
- Counted same coffee-cup 5 times across duplicate frames
```

### After Fix:
```
chunk_10_20250701_150000: 2 objects (water: 2) [hands: {2: 1, 3: 1}]
- Hand 2: 1 water bottle (frequent across frames)
- Hand 3: 1 water bottle (frequent across frames)
- Total: 2 objects (frequency-based)

chunk_10_20250701_150031: 1 objects (coffee-cup: 1) [hands: {14: 1}]
- Hand 14: 1 coffee-cup (frequent across 5 duplicate frames)
- Total: 1 object (frequency-based)
```

## Testing

1. **Re-run object classification** with padding to improve detection rates
2. **Re-run intersection analysis** to get hand-specific counts
3. **Check annotated images** to verify hand boxes and intersections
4. **Review per-frame CSV** to see objects-per-hand breakdown

The system now correctly handles:
- âœ… Multiple hands with separate objects
- âœ… Multiple objects per single hand  
- âœ… Near-miss intersections (with padding)
- âœ… Duplicate frame handling (frequency-based counting)
- âœ… Intelligent object counting per hand across frames
